			<pre><h4 class="employer"><a href="https://www.ato.gov.au" target="_blank">Australian Taxation Office</a>   |   <span class="dates">December 2004 to January 2013</span></h4></pre>
			<p class="position">Senior Business Analyst (Executive Level 1)</p>
			<h5>Overview</h5>
			<p>At the Australian Taxation Office I worked in the Revenue Analysis Branch (RAB) - the role of RAB is monitoring, analyzing and forecasting the various tax revenue streams collected by the Australian Government. RAB is also responsible for estimating the impact of proposed policy changes and/or risks to those revenue streams, by producing policy costings. Advice from RAB on forecasts feeds directly into the official Treasury forecasts provided to the Australian Government. Policy costings produced by RAB are often used as the Government's official costings, subject to Treasury's quality assurance.</p>
			<h5>Responsibilities</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Monitoring and analyzing company tax revenue collections to identify underlying patterns, trends, indicators and/or other information</li>
				<li>Forecasting of company tax revenues using various sources of data and forecasting techniques</li>
				<li>Extracting data from a Teradata Data Warehouse environment using SQL</li>
				<li>Matching, cleaning, processing and analyzing extracted data using Excel based tools such as pivot tables, array functions and lookups, a variety of charts and plots, attribute construction, categorization and regression</li>
				<li>Writing reports for senior ATO and Treasury officials on a monthly basis, detailing the status of tax collections, as well as highlighting any changes or information that may impact on future collections</li>
				<li>Supervising, mentoring and guiding junior staff members undertaking forecasting, analytical and monitoring roles for other taxation revenue streams</li>
				<li>Representing the team and RAB in meetings with senior executives from the ATO, the Treasury and on several occasions, foreign delegates</li>
				<li>Acting as the EL2 manager of the team (typically 8-10 people) which required me to direct avenues of enquiry and analysis, drive model development, provide quality assurance, and sign off on any work completed</li>
			</ul>
			<h5>Achievements</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>I was promoted four times in my first three years from entry level to Executive Level 1.</li> 
				<li>In 2008, I received the Commissioner's Award for innovation<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/uploadedFiles/Content/CR/downloads/Annual%20report%202008-09.pdf" title="ATO Annual Report 2008-09 pg. 143" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a>. This award is the highest award that can be given to an ATO employee and each category is typically given to one or two people each year out of the 24,000+ employees working for the ATO. I received this award for two pieces of work:
					<ul>
						<li>I designed, built and implemented an electronic filing system and integrated work tracker for the policy teams in RAB that greatly simplified the record keeping process and allowed, through a macro, users to directly access work folders from the work register</li>
						<li>I designed and built a company tax timing model which allowed policy analysts to quickly and accurately convert the revenue impacts of policies affecting company tax collections from an income year basis to a cash basis by modeling the complex Australian system of substituted accounting periods, company tax installments and balancing payments/refunds</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
